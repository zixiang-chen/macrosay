# A Brief Self-introduction

If you are a developer, why don't you host your own websites? That is the initiative for this website.

My name is Zixiang Chen(陈子翔 in Chinese), and you can call me Macro, for short. Currently, I am a teacher at a vocational school, but recently I reposted my goals to be a full-stack software engineer. I'm working hard for my new career. This website, my first immature portfolio project, is built with React as frontend technology and Google Firebase as backend database services.

I'm working hard on learning English, too. I deeply feel that collaborative learning is a great way to develop skills. If you're interested in learning together with me, please feel free to contact me.
